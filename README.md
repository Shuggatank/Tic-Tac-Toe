<h1 align="center">Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>

<p>The purpose of this project was to create a browser Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We created this project from nothing into a fully functioning game. We were given a few user stories and technical requirements as well as some extra goals to guide our projects.
